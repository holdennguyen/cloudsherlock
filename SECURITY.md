# Reporting Security Issues

The Cloud Sherlock team and community take security bugs in Cloud Sherlock seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/holdennguyen/cloudsherlock/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Cloud Sherlock team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [crates contact form](https://crates.io/support) by selecting "Report a crate that violates policies".
